                Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee<br /> Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite
                different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally:
                maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked
                so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like
                a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful. I was
                SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again
                Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!

                I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.<br /> Maybe it's because I had
                higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to achieve
                what the other one couldn't. I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and
                it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion,
                but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and
                an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone
                bad, but it played out quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed
                in the saga would also enjoy it.
