            <p>Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads a double life. At work he is a government agent with a license to
                do just about anything, while at home he pretends to be a dull computer salesman. He is on the trail of stolen
                nuclear weapons that are in the hands of fanatic terrorists when something more important comes up. Harry
                finds his wife is seeing another man (Bill Paxton) because she needs some adventure in her life. Harry decides
                to give it to her, juggling pursuit of terrorists on one hand and an adventure for his wife on the other
                while showing he can Tango all at once. Written by John Vogel

                <p> A retired special agent named John Matrix
            led an elite unit and has left the armed forces to live in a secluded mountain home with his daughter Jenny.
            But now he is forced out of retirement when his daughter is kidnapped by a band of thugs intent on revenge! Unbeknownst
            to Matrix, the members of his former unit are being killed one by one. Even though Matrix' friend General Franklin
            Kirby gives Matrix armed guards, attackers manage to kidnap Matrix and Jenny. Matrix learns that Bennett, a former
            member of his Matrix' unit who was presumed dead has kidnapped him to try to force Matrix to do a political assassination
            for a man called Arius (who calls himself El Presidente), a warlord formerly bested by Matrix who wishes to lead
            a military coup in his home country. Since Arius will have Jenny killed if Matrix refuses, Matrix reluctantly
            accepts the demand. Written by Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}
